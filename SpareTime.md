**Spare Time** 

In my spare time I like to hunt and fish with my friends and family.  

Check out below for a picture of a set of ducks that I killed recently.

Sometimes I like to do a little coding here's an example. 

```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print ('FizzBuzz')
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print ('Fizz')
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print ('Buzz')
    else:
        print (str(i))
```
